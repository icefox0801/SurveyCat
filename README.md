## Tutorial
If you want to launch a survey named **mySurvey**, you can launch it following the steps below:
### 1. Initialize the survey
```sh
$ surveycat init mySurvey
13:31:50 INFO  Initializing a survey
? title:  mySurvey
? description:  Please read and answer the questions below carefully
? port:  8016
? type:  paper
? start datetime:  2016-06-24 13:31
? end datetime:  2016-06-25 13:31
13:32:08 INFO  Finish initializing a survey named mySurvey
```
Note that:
1. `port` is on which you start your survey as a node server
2. `type` now support `paper` and `carousel`
3. `start datetime` and `end datetime` can accept date format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`, `YYYY-MM-DD`

### 2. Config the questions of the survey
```sh
$ surveycat config mySurvey
```
After execute the command, a configuration page will be opened in the browser:

You can config the questions of the survey on this page and then submit them.

### 3. Start the survey
```sh
$ surveycat start mySurvey
```
After execute the command, a survey page will be opened in the browser:

Then you can share the url with you teammates! If `http://ipaddress` sucks, you can upload the static page to an VPS and modify the submit url manually.

### 4. Checking the survey report
```sh
$ surveycat report mySurvey
```
After execute the command, a survey report page will be opened in the browser:
